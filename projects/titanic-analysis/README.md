# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project analyzes the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival using Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest models in R.

## Files
- `titanic_analysis.Rmd`: Full R Markdown analysis with code and plots
- `train.csv`: Training dataset
- `test.csv`: Test dataset
- `submission.csv`: Submission file
- `output/`: Contains model prediction results (`res.csv`, `res_dt.csv`, `res_rf.csv`)

## Highlights
- **Logistic Regression F1 Score:** ~0.8588
- **Decision Tree F1 Score:** ~0.8376
- **Random Forest F1 Score:** ~0.8473

## Key Findings
- Higher survival rate for passengers from port 'C'
- First-class passengers survived more
- Family size 2â€“5 had better survival odds
- Higher fares correlated with survival
